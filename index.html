                <p>My work varies on creating beautiful creatures to making clients look radiant. Makeup came naturally to me, I was inspired to think outside the box, for years I educated myself, then I moved on to studying at the Cinema Makeup School in Los Angeles. Since then I've been studying and working so I can transform my clients in beauty and special effects. Makeup is a passion and an art form, and any chance of sharing that with a client is an opportunity to inspire those to think outside the box.</p>
